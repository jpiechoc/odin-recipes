        <h2>Why It's So Tosty</h2>
        <p>As much as I love an Instant Pot for the easy things, I also love it for the complicated things (which are still easy in an Instant Pot). What I mean is, sure easy things are still great to make, but what makes this appliance really stand out is its ability to take a typically complicated recipe and really simplify it and make it fast while keeping its integrity. I hope I didn't lose you with my own confusing logic there.  </p>
        <p>I'm not sure if Julia Child would agree with me, and she'd probably rather go the long route, but then again, she's amazing. But in today's fast-paced world that pulls us in a million directions every day, some things just need to be simplified. Like pot roast.</p>

        <h3>For the Mashed Potatoes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8oz Sour Cream</li>
            <li>1 Tsp Salt</li>
            <li>1/4 Tsp Pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tsp Minced Garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Follow These Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice the onion, celery, and jalapeño (scrape the seeds out of the jalapeño before dicing). Mince the garlic. Add the onion, celery, jalapeño, garlic, and olive oil to a large soup pot and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft and translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken breast, chicken broth, diced tomatoes with chiles (with juices), oregano, and cumin to the pot. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to high, and bring the broth up to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and let the pot simmer for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>After simmering for 45 minutes, carefully remove the chicken breast from the pot and use two forks to shred the meat. Return the shredded meat to the pot. Squeeze the juice of one lime into the soup (2-3 Tbsp juice).</li>
            <li>Rinse the cilantro and then roughly chop the leaves. Add the chopped cilantro to the soup, give it a quick stir, then serve. Slice the avocado and add a few slices to each bowl.</li>
