        <h2>Why It's So Tosty</h2>
        <p>We have a specialty in Japan known as Tonkatsu (とんかつ, 豚かつ) or deep-fried pork cutlet. This western-inspired dish has been enjoyed for over 120 years, with the recipe remaining mostly unchanged since then. So, what makes Tonkatsu special, and how can we make this popular dish at home? Believe it or not, making Japanese pork cutlet at home is easier than you think and should take no more than 30 minutes!</p>
        <h2>Run Out to Publix and Get:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Boneless Pork Loin Chops</li>
            <li>1/2 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>1/8 Tsp Freshly Ground Black Pepper</li>
            <li>3 Cups Neutral Flavored Oil</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1 Large Egg</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup Panko</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Follow These Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients. For Tonkatsu, I highly recommend getting fresh panko (we call it <i>nama panko</i>) from a Japanese grocery store. If you can’t get it, follow my instructions to make fresh panko. Make sure to use a Japanese brand of panko from Japan. Western “panko breadcrumbs” are a bit different from authentic Japanese panko.</li>
            <li>You can always cut the cabbage super thinly with a sharp knife, but I love this cabbage slicer and it saves time and energy! I also thinly slice the cucumber diagonally, then cut them into thin strips. Toss the cabbage and cucumber together and set aside.</li>
            <li>Grind the white and black toasted sesame seeds with a Japanese pestle and mortar. Leave some seeds unground for texture.</li>
            <li>In individual small plates or bowls, serve 1 Tbsp of the ground sesame seeds and add the tonkatsu sauce. Each person can mix it together when they are ready to eat.</li>
            <li>Put store-bought dry panko in a deep dish and spray with water until the panko is moist (I use this mister). Set aside for 15 minutes, or until the panko becomes soft and tender. You can also use a food processor to make fresh panko from shokupan (Japanese Pullman bread).</li>
            <li>With a sharp knife, remove the extra fat and make several slits on the connective tissue (white area) between the meat and fat. Red meat and fat have different elasticities, and when they are cooked, they will shrink and expand at different rates. These slits will allow the tonkatsu to stay nice and flat when deep-frying and prevent it from curling up.</li>
            <li>Crack the egg in a deep dish and add the oil. Whisk together until well combined. By adding oil, the meat and breading won’t detach from each other while deep-frying and the juice and flavor from the meat will not escape easily. Prepare a deep dish for the flour, too.</li>
            <li>Dredge the pork in the flour and dust off any excess. Excess flour will create a coating that prevents the egg mixture from adhering to the pork. Then, dip the pork into the egg mixture and coat well.</li>
            <li>Dredge the pork in the panko,  gently pressing down the panko onto the pork and then gently shaking off any excess before placing the pork pieces onto a tray or plate. While deep-frying, the panko will “puff up,” so at this stage they don’t have to be fluffy. Set it aside for 5-10 minutes so the breading will set.</li>
