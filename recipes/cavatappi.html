    <h2>Why This is So Tosty</h2>
    <p>A bowl of pasta never fails to satisfy—it’s quick, carby, comforting, and our total weeknight go-to. When you add sweet Italian chicken sausage, tender bites of zucchini, and Parmesan to the equation, you’ve reached another level of deliciousness entirely. Ready to enjoy bite after bite of twisty cavatappi pasta cloaked in this creamy, flavor-boosted Bolognese? We thought so.</p>
    <h2>Run out to Publix and get:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Yellow Onion</li>
        <li>1 Zucchini</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>6 oz Cavatappi Pasta</li>
        <li>1.5 oz Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>9 oz Italian Chicken Sausage Mix</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Chicken Stock Concentrate</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Sour Cream</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Parmesan Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Follow These Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce</li>
        <li>Trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; cut crosswise into ½-inch-thick half-moons. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion.</li>
        <li>Toss zucchini on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, half the Italian Seasoning (you'll use the rest later), and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Roast on top rack, tossing halfway through, until browned and tender, 14-16 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once water is boiling, add cavatappi to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reserve 1½ cups pasta cooking water (2 cups for 4 servings), then drain.</li>
        <li>While pasta cooks, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5-6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add sausage and cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned, 3-4 minutes (it'll finish cooking in the next step).</li>
        <li>Add tomato paste and remaining Italian Seasoning to pan. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in stock concentrate, 1 cup reserved pasta cooking water (1½ cups for 4 servings), and a big pinch of salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer; cook until sauce has slightly thickened and sausage is cooked through, 2-3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
