My first HTML project - only the best recipes around

The purpose of this project is to build a basic recipe website. The website will have a main index page with links to a few recipes.

By the end of this project, I hope to demonstrate:
-   Using the command line interface to set up a file structure for the website.
-   Connecting the website to GitHub
-   Setting up the standard HTML boilerplate text from memory
-   Using basic HTML elements such as heading, anchor, image, and list tags.
